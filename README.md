# CuckooConsistent
Ankit Gupta and Jonah Kallenbach, Harvard University

This is a repository for the final project of Ankit Gupta and Jonah Kallenbach, in Harvard University's CS 223, Spring 2015. 

# Usage:

Classes:  
cuckoorings.hpp contains the implementation of CuckooRings  
ringhash.hpp contains the implementation of RingHash, which CuckooRings uses  

Tests:  
InsertKeys Test: insertiontest.cpp  
RemoveServer Test: rmservertest.cpp  
RandomActions Test: randomactionstest.cpp

Dependencies:
C++11

We used analysisgrapher.py to convert the output of the test files into a chart for the report. We also did some debugging using test.cpp, but there won't be very much of interest in there.
